Explanation
Creating the Project: The flutter create command sets up a new Flutter project with default directories and files.
Updating lib/main.dart: We replaced the default content with a simple app that has a home page displaying a welcome message.
Modifying pubspec.yaml: This file lists dependencies, assets, and other configuration details for your Flutter project. We added google_maps_flutter to use Google Maps in our app.
Adding API Key in Manifest: The AndroidManifest.xml file is essential for configuring your Android app. The <meta-data> tag is used to specify your Google Maps API key, which is necessary for using Google Maps services.
